# Amazon-Clone
This project is a simplified clone of the Amazon website, built using HTML and CSS. It replicates the basic structure and design of Amazon's homepage, including a responsive navigation bar, product listings, search bar, and footer. The project focuses on clean layout design, responsive styling, and proper semantic HTML structure, providing a foundation for understanding e-commerce website design principles.
